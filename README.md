# Email Scraper

A command line utility to scrape emails from a web page using Python 3.4.3. You can download Python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you're not sure what version of Python you're using, type `$ python --version` or `$ python3 --version` in the terminal.

It's dependent on the following external libraries:
- Beautiful Soup
- Selenium

To install the libraries, type the following in the terminal:
````bash
$ sudo pip3 install bs4
$ sudo pip3 install selenium
````
My implementation also requires Firefox to be installed on the computer. If you don't have Firefox, you can download it [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/).
